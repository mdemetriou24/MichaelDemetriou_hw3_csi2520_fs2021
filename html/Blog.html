            As a first generation American from Greeece, this is my favorite place to visit! 
            Although Greece has its major cities with bars, clubs and partying, it has much 
            much more to offer than that. As you can see in the video ive posted Greece has 
            every type of climate, from beaches, lakes and rivers
            to mountains, forests and flatlands. It has thousands of islands all with their 
            own unique things and along with that Greece has a hisotry unlike no other. 
            With the mixture of ancient Greece and modern Greece 
            seen at almost ever corner you turn it is truely a magnificant land.
